    "## SQL Joins Tutorial\n",
    "\n",
    "A SQL join is where you run a query that joins multiple tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "This SQL joins tutorial presents basic examples of SQL joins, as well as an introduction to the various join types.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### SQL Join Types\n",
    "\n",
    "The ANSI SQL standard specifies five types of joins, as listed in the following table.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Join Type:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### INNER JOIN:\n",
    "Returns rows when there is at least one row in both tables that match the join condition.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### LEFT OUTER JOIN or LEFT JOIN:\n",
    "Returns rows that have data in the left table (left of the JOIN keyword), even if there’s no matching rows in the right table.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### RIGHT OUTER JOIN or RIGHT JOIN:\n",
    "Returns rows that have data in the right table (right of the JOIN keyword), even if there’s no matching rows in the left table.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### FULL OUTER JOIN or FULL JOIN:\n",
    "Returns all rows, as long as there’s matching data in one of the tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### CROSS JOIN:\n",
    "Returns rows which combine each row from the first table with each row from the second table.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "There are also other terms for various join operations, such as the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Self-join:\n",
    "When a table joins to itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Natural join:\n",
    "An implicit join based on the common columns in the two tables being joined.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Equi-join:\n",
    "A join containing only equality comparisons in the join predicate.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### SQL Join Syntax:\n",
    "Inner joins can be specified in either the FROM or WHERE clauses. Outer joins and cross joins can be specified in the FROM clause only.\n",
    "\n",
    "To create a SQL join in the FROM clause, do something like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "SELECT *\n",
    "FROM Table1 < JoinType > Table2 [ ON ( JoinCondition ) ]\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Where JoinType specifies what kind of join is performed, and JoinCondition defines the predicate to be evaluated for each pair of joined rows.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "To specify a join in the WHERE clause, do something like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "SELECT *\n",
    "FROM Table1, Table2 [ WHERE ( JoinCondition ) ]\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Again, JoinCondition defines the predicate to be evaluated for each pair of joined rows.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, everything enclosed in square brackets ([]) is optional.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sample Tables for the Examples in this Tutorial\n",
    "Most of the examples in this tutorial perform joins against the following two tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "The PetTypes table:\n",

    "\n",
    "#### The Inner Join\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The SQL INNER JOIN returns rows when there is at least one row in both tables that match the join condition.\n",
    "\n",
    "SELECT Pets.PetName, PetTypes.PetType\n",
    "FROM Pets\n",
    "INNER JOIN PetTypes\n",
    "ON Pets.PetTypeId = PetTypes.PetTypeId;\n",
    "Result:\n",
    "\n",
    "                -----------+-----------+\n",
    "                | PetName   | PetType   |\n",
    "                |-----------+-----------|\n",
    "                | Fluffy    | Cat       |\n",
    "                | Fetch     | Dog       |\n",
    "                | Scratch   | Cat       |\n",
    "                | Wag       | Dog       |\n",
    "                | Tweet     | Bird      | \n",
    "                | Fluffy    | Dog       |\n",
    "                | Bark      | Dog       |\n",
    "                | Meow      | Cat       |\n",
    "                +-----------+-----------+\n",
    "                (8 rows affected)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "To specify an inner join in the FROM clause, we use INNER JOIN. We also use the ON keyword to define the predicate to be evaluated for each pair of joined rows.\n",
    "\n",
    "Regardless of the join type, we qualify our column names with the table names. The reason we do this is to avoid any ambiguity regarding the column names between the tables. Both tables could have columns of the same name (like in our example), and in such cases, the DBMS won’t know which column you’re referring to. Prefixing the column names with their table names ensures that you’re referencing the right column, and prevents any errors that could result from any ambiguity about which column you’re referring to.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, both tables have a PetTypeId column. The Pets.PetTypeId column is a foreign key to the PetTypes.PetTypeId column, which is the primary key for that table.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we can see that all pets are returned, but not all of the pet types are returned. There are no rabbits in the Pets table, and so the Rabbits pet type is not returned.\n",
    "\n",
    "The reason the Rabbits type is not returned is because the INNER JOIN only returns rows when there is at least one row in both tables that match the join condition. In this case, Rabbits is only in one table (the PetTypes table).\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the join type is optional. Therefore, most (if not all) DBMSs allow you to omit the INNER keyword. When you omit this (i.e. only specify JOIN), it is assumed to be an inner join.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, we could rewrite the above example to this:\n",
    "\n",
    "SELECT Pets.PetName, PetTypes.PetType\n",
    "FROM Pets\n",
    "JOIN PetTypes\n",
    "ON Pets.PetTypeId = PetTypes.PetTypeId;\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, as with any SQL statement, the FROM clause can be on one whole line if you prefer:\n",
    "\n",
    "SELECT Pets.PetName, PetTypes.PetType\n",
    "FROM Pets JOIN PetTypes ON Pets.PetTypeId = PetTypes.PetTypeId;\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Aliases\n",
    "It’s common practice to use table aliases when performing SQL joins. Aliases help to make the code more concise, and easier to read.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, we could change the previous example to this:\n",
    "\n",
    "SELECT p.PetName, pt.PetType\n",
    "FROM Pets p INNER JOIN PetTypes pt\n",
    "ON p.PetTypeId = pt.PetTypeId;\n",
    "Result:\n",
    "\n",
    "                        -----------+-----------+\n",
    "                        | PetName   | PetType   |\n",
    "                        |-----------+-----------|\n",
    "                        | Fluffy    | Cat       |\n",
    "                        | Fetch     | Dog       |\n",
    "                        | Scratch   | Cat       |\n",
    "                        | Wag       | Dog       |\n",
    "                        | Tweet     | Bird      |\n",
    "                        | Fluffy    | Dog       |\n",
    "                        | Bark      | Dog       |\n",
    "                        | Meow      | Cat       |\n",
    "                        +-----------+-----------+\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The Equi-Join\n",
    "\n",
    "The above join can also be referred to as an equi-join. An equi-join is a join containing only equality comparisons in the join predicate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another way of writing the above join is like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "SELECT p.PetName, pt.PetType\n",
    "FROM  Pets p, PetTypes pt\n",
    "WHERE p.PetTypeId = pt.PetTypeId;\n",
    "Result:\n",
    "\n",
    "                        -----------+-----------+\n",
    "                        | PetName   | PetType   |\n",
    "                        |-----------+-----------|\n",
    "                        | Fluffy    | Cat       |\n",
    "                        | Fetch     | Dog       |\n",
    "                        | Scratch   | Cat       |\n",
    "                        | Wag       | Dog       |\n",
    "                        | Tweet     | Bird      |\n",
    "                        | Fluffy    | Dog       |\n",

    "                        | Meow      | Cat       |\n",
    "                        +-----------+-----------+\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This is an example of specifying an inner join in the WHERE clause. We simply provided a comma separated list of the tables, and then a WHERE condition. If we’d omitted the WHERE condition, we would’ve ended up with a CROSS JOIN.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many beginners find the above syntax much easier to understand than the INNER JOIN syntax. Feel free to use this syntax if you prefer, however, be aware that most SQL professionals prefer to use the INNER JOIN syntax from the previous example.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The Right Join\n",
    "\n",
    "Also known as the RIGHT OUTER JOIN, the RIGHT JOIN returns rows that have data in the right table (right of the JOIN keyword), even if there’s no matching rows in the left table.\n",
    "\n",
    "SELECT p.PetName, pt.PetType\n",
    "FROM Pets p\n",
    "RIGHT JOIN PetTypes pt\n",
    "ON p.PetTypeId = pt.PetTypeId;\n",

    "                        (9 rows affected)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, we got an extra PetType value – Rabbit – even though there’s no pet in the Pets table of that type. This results in a NULL value in the PetName column against Rabbit.\n",
    "\n",
    "See SQL Right Join for more examples, including a right join that joins 3 tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The Left Join\n",
    "\n",
    "Also known as the LEFT OUTER JOIN, the SQL LEFT JOIN returns rows that have data in the left table (left of the JOIN keyword), even if there’s no matching rows in the right table.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the opposite of the RIGHT JOIN.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "#### The Full Join\n",
